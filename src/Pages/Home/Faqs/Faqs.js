              <Accordion.Body>
                (CORS) Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is a mechanism that enables
                many resources (e.g., JavaScript, fonts etc.) on a web page to
                be requested from another domain outside the domain from which
                the resource originated. It is a mechanism supported in HTML5
                that manages XMLHttpRequest access to a domain different.

              <Accordion.Body>
                An ETag is an opaque identifier allocated by a web server to a
                specific version of a resource found at a URL. The ETag is a
                part of HTTP, the protocol for the world wide web and when the
                server reads the ETag from client request, the server can then
                tell whether to send the file (HTTP 200) or tell the client just
                to use their local copy (HTTP 304).

              <Accordion.Header>Explain what is long polling?</Accordion.Header>
              <Accordion.Body>
                Long polling is a web application development pattern used to
                emulate pushing data from the server to the client. When the
                long polling is used, the client sends a request to the server,
                and the connection remains intact until the server is ready to
                send data to the client. The connection will be closed only
                after the data is sent back to the client or connection timeout
                occurs.
